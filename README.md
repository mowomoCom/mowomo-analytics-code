Light and simple plugin to insert the Google Analytics Tracking Code between the <head> tag of your WordPress.

== About the plugin ==
This plugin has been programmed to make easier the Google Analytics Tracking Code insertion in your WordPress. If you just need that functionality, this is your plugin, because it just includes the Google Analytics Tracking Code between <head> tags in your WordPress. You won't need to install heavy plugins if you only want to do that.

It's easy to use because you only have to complete the Analytics user id field and that would be all.

== Installation ==

1. You have to upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or to install the plugin through the plugins section in your WordPress panel.
2. Activate the plugin in the 'Plugins' section in your WordPress panel.
3. In the Analytics Code section you will setup your plugin.
4. Add your user ID.
